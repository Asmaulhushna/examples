A set [learning exercises for Go.](http://tour.golang.org/) Excellent way to interactively and quickly learn Go. It reminds me, delightfully and ruefully of Python and Scala, mixed with C, but with trimmed syntax nuances, absence of tabs as token separator, and enhanced readbility.


Despite some critics, Go has adopted a rapid following, in particular writing system software, agents, and distrubuted programming. Its built-in concurrancy patterns lends itself well to writing concurrent programs. Robert Pike, creator of the language and UNIX's legendary co-founder now at Google, notes eloquently that [concurrency != parallelism].(https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cN_DpYBzKso) 

You can watch his lectures on [Youtube] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cF1zJYkBW4A). And if you're thinking of writing systems or distributed systems, where concurrency is inherent in your tasks, think about Go. Think about its Concurrency Patterns, and think about its efficiency and brevity of language.

Just like any new programming language, an interactive and quick way to start is by doing it. So get started, and [GO!] (https://blog.golang.org/playground)
