#A Simple Producer (publisher) and Consumer (subscriber) for Confluent 2.0 with Apache Spark 0.9

##Thou Shall Publish...Thy Shall Subscribe...
For as long as there have been printing papers, there have been publishers and consumers. 
In ancient times the King's scribes were the publishers, the pigeon the courier or transport, and remote Lords of the Houses the consumers or subscribers. In modern times, in the digital era, data is securely and reliably published and selectively subscribed.In other words, the publish/subscribe paradigm is not new; it's old.
