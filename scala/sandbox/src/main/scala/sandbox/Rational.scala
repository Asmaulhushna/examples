/**
  * Created by jules on 3/13/16.
  * A immutable class to represent and encapsulate rational numbers. This class illustrates how one would go about defining an immutable object,
  * the Scala way. This example is borrowed from Progamming in Scala, 2nd Ed. by Martin Odersky and et al (pg. 111, Listing 6.5
  *
  * Comments adderd below for my clearification and learning knowledge.
  *
  * More than showing how to think of immutable objects class design, it denomstrates how to implement operators by
  * defining them as Scala wouldâ€”by generating another object not mutating the current state.
